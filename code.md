# This is where you will learn how to display code in markdown :)

## In ***this*** example I will be using ***HTML***.

 <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  
    <head>
      <title> My Wonderful Code</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
      <h1> 
        Today is a good day.
      </h1>
      <p> To be honest, there isn't much else to talk about when put on the spot to write about yourself. So I will just leave it like this :) </p>
    </body>
  </html>

## You will first want to make sure every line is indented by a tab. Make sure to declare the the html document as well, and from there walahh, continue coding!
