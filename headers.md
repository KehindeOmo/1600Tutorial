# This is probably the easiest section.
## To make a header you just need to add a hashtag before your sentence & make sure a space is present
## The number of hashtags before your sentence determines how big the font is. The more hashtags the smaller the header is..... for ex:


# HI  
## HI
### HI
#### HI
##### HI
###### HI

> This is an example without the spaces in between the hashtag and the word --------->     #HI
##HI
###HI
####HI
#####HI
######HI
